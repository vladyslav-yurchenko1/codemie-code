# Spec Reviewer: Technical Specification Review

## Purpose

This skill reviews technical specifications and implementation plans produced by superpowers:writing-plans or superpowers:brainstorming to ensure they:
- Address all requirements from the Jira ticket
- Follow project design guidelines from `.codemie/guides/`
- Comply with architectural principles and patterns
- Are focused, clear, and implementation-ready

The skill provides a binary verdict (APPROVED or NEEDS WORK) with critical feedback only—no minor comments, no code snippets.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- superpowers:writing-plans has produced an implementation plan or spec doc
- superpowers:brainstorming has produced a design document
- Before starting implementation of a complex feature
- User asks to "review spec", "validate specification", "check design doc"
- Need to verify specification against Jira ticket requirements
- Want to ensure spec follows project design principles

## Review Workflow

### Phase 1: Input Gathering

**Step 1: Obtain Specification**

Get the technical specification to review:
- **From user message**: User provides spec content directly
- **From file path**: User provides path to spec file (use Read tool)
- **From previous context**: Spec was generated earlier in conversation

**Step 2: Identify Jira Ticket**

Extract Jira ticket ID from specification or ask user:
- Look for `EPMCDME-XXXXX` pattern in spec
- If not found, ask user for ticket ID
- Use brianna skill to fetch ticket description and summary

```
Use Skill tool with skill="brianna" and args:
"Get ticket details for EPMCDME-XXXXX. I need only the description and summary fields."
```

### Phase 2: Criteria Loading

**Step 3: Load Relevant Project Guides**

Based on spec content, load applicable guides from `.codemie/guides/`:

| Spec Mentions | Load Guide (P0) | Also Load (P1) |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Architecture, layers, components | .codemie/guides/architecture/architecture.md | - |
| API, endpoints, REST | .codemie/guides/api/ (if exists) | .codemie/guides/architecture/architecture.md |
| Agent, plugin, registry | .codemie/guides/architecture/architecture.md | .codemie/guides/integration/external-integrations.md |
| Security, auth, credentials | .codemie/guides/security/security-practices.md | .codemie/guides/development/development-practices.md |
| Testing, mocking, coverage | .codemie/guides/testing/testing-patterns.md | - |
| Error handling, logging | .codemie/guides/development/development-practices.md | .codemie/guides/standards/code-quality.md |
| Provider, LLM, integration | .codemie/guides/integration/external-integrations.md | .codemie/guides/architecture/architecture.md |
| Git, workflow, CI/CD | .codemie/guides/standards/git-workflow.md | - |

**Step 4: Identify Design Principles**

Extract key design principles from loaded guides:
- Layered architecture rules (CLI → Registry → Plugin → Core → Utils)
- Plugin isolation principles
- Error handling patterns
- Security requirements
- Testing strategies
- Dependency rules

### Phase 3: Critical Review

**Step 5: Verify Against Jira Ticket**

Compare specification to Jira ticket requirements:

**CRITICAL Issues** (Must report):
- ❌ Missing acceptance criteria not addressed in spec
- ❌ Misalignment with ticket goals or scenarios
- ❌ Spec solves different problem than ticket describes
- ❌ Key user-facing functionality omitted

**NOT Critical** (Skip):
- Minor wording differences
- Implementation details beyond ticket scope
- Additional nice-to-have features

**Step 6: Verify Against Design Principles**

Check spec compliance with project design guidelines:

#### Architecture Violations (CRITICAL)

From `.codemie/guides/architecture/architecture.md`:

**Must Report**:
- ❌ Skipping architectural layers (e.g., CLI directly calls Plugin)
- ❌ Core layer depending on Plugin layer (dependency inversion violation)
- ❌ Plugin-to-Plugin direct dependencies
- ❌ Business logic in CLI layer
- ❌ Missing registry registration for new plugins

**Example Feedback Format**:
```markdown
**Architecture Violation**: Spec proposes CLI command directly instantiating ClaudePlugin.
**Principle**: CLI → Registry → Plugin flow (5-layer architecture)
**Reference**: .codemie/guides/architecture/architecture.md:246-273 (Communication Rules)
**Impact**: Breaks plugin isolation, makes testing difficult, violates Open/Closed principle
```

#### Security Violations (CRITICAL)

From `.codemie/guides/security/security-practices.md`:

**Must Report**:
- ❌ Hardcoded credentials or API keys in spec
- ❌ Missing input validation for user-provided data
- ❌ Logging sensitive data without sanitization
- ❌ File path operations without security checks
- ❌ Missing CredentialStore usage for credential storage

**Example Feedback Format**:
```markdown
**Security Violation**: Spec shows API key stored in configuration file.
**Principle**: No hardcoded credentials, use CredentialStore
**Reference**: .codemie/guides/security/security-practices.md (Credential Storage section)
**Impact**: Credentials exposed in version control, security risk
```

#### Error Handling Violations (CRITICAL)

From `.codemie/guides/development/development-practices.md`:

**Must Report**:
- ❌ Using generic Error instead of specific error classes
- ❌ Missing error context for debugging
- ❌ Swallowing errors without logging
- ❌ No error propagation strategy defined

**Example Feedback Format**:
```markdown
**Error Handling Violation**: Spec uses generic Error for agent not found.
**Principle**: Use specific error classes from src/utils/errors.ts
**Reference**: .codemie/guides/development/development-practices.md (Error Handling section)
**Impact**: Poor user experience, difficult debugging, no structured error handling
```

#### Testing Violations (CRITICAL)

From `.codemie/guides/testing/testing-patterns.md`:

**Must Report**:
- ❌ No testing strategy defined for complex features
- ❌ Mixing unit and integration test concerns
- ❌ Missing test isolation strategy
- ❌ Incorrect mocking approach (static imports without dynamic loading)

**Example Feedback Format**:
```markdown
**Testing Violation**: Spec proposes static imports for modules that need mocking.
**Principle**: Use dynamic imports after beforeEach for mockable modules
**Reference**: .codemie/guides/testing/testing-patterns.md (Dynamic Imports section)
**Impact**: Tests cannot properly mock dependencies, brittle test suite
```

#### Integration Violations (CRITICAL)

From `.codemie/guides/integration/external-integrations.md`:

**Must Report**:
- ❌ Direct integration without provider abstraction
- ❌ Missing error handling for external service failures
- ❌ No retry or timeout strategy for external calls
- ❌ Hardcoded external service URLs

**Step 7: Verify Focus and Clarity**

Check specification quality:

**CRITICAL Issues** (Must report):
- ❌ Spec is vague or ambiguous about key implementation details
- ❌ Multiple disconnected features bundled together
- ❌ Missing critical interfaces or contracts
- ❌ Unclear component responsibilities
- ❌ No clear success criteria or validation approach

**NOT Critical** (Skip):
- Minor typos or grammatical issues
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Missing diagrams (unless critical for understanding)
- Overly verbose explanations

### Phase 4: Verdict and Feedback

**Step 8: Provide Review Verdict**

Format review results as follows:

#### If NO Critical Issues Found:

```markdown
## Specification Review: APPROVED ✅

**Jira Ticket**: EPMCDME-XXXXX
**Specification**: [Title or path]

### Verdict
This specification is **APPROVED** for implementation.

### Review Summary
- ✅ Addresses all Jira ticket acceptance criteria
- ✅ Follows 5-layer architecture principles
- ✅ Complies with security guidelines
- ✅ Proper error handling strategy defined
- ✅ Clear component responsibilities and interfaces
- ✅ [Additional positive findings]

### Next Steps
Proceed with implementation. Tech-lead will invoke superpowers:subagent-driven-development to begin implementation.
```

#### If Critical Issues Found:

```markdown
## Specification Review: NEEDS WORK ⚠️

**Jira Ticket**: EPMCDME-XXXXX
**Specification**: [Title or path]

### Verdict
This specification **REQUIRES ADDITIONAL WORK** before implementation.

### Critical Issues

#### 1. [Issue Category] - [Brief Title]
**Violation**: [What principle/requirement is violated]
**Principle**: [Which design principle from guides]

[Continue for all critical issues]

### Jira Ticket Alignment

[If applicable]
- ❌ Acceptance criterion "[text]" not addressed
- ❌ Scenario "[text]" not covered
- ❌ [Other alignment issues]

### Recommendations

[High-level guidance - NO code snippets]
1. [Action to address issue category 1]
2. [Action to address issue category 2]
3. [Action to address issue category 3]

### Next Steps
Address critical issues above, then resubmit specification for review.

[Spec: New REST endpoint following existing patterns]

Spec Reviewer:
1. Fetches EPMCDME-10500 via brianna
2. Loads .codemie/guides/architecture/architecture.md
3. Reviews spec:
   - Follows CLI → Registry → Plugin architecture ✅
   - Uses existing error classes ✅
   - Addresses all acceptance criteria ✅
   - Clear interfaces defined ✅
4. Verdict: APPROVED ✅
5. Recommends: Proceed with implementation
```

### Example 2: NEEDS WORK - Architecture Violation

[Spec: New agent with CLI directly calling plugin code]

Spec Reviewer:
1. Fetches EPMCDME-10600 via brianna
2. Loads .codemie/guides/architecture/architecture.md
3. Identifies CRITICAL issue:
   - Spec shows CLI command directly instantiating agent plugin
   - Violates 5-layer architecture (CLI → Registry → Plugin)
   - Reference: architecture.md:246-273
4. Verdict: NEEDS WORK ⚠️
5. Feedback: "CLI must call AgentRegistry.getAgent(), not instantiate plugin directly"
```

### Example 3: NEEDS WORK - Security Violation

```
User: "Review this spec for EPMCDME-10700"
[Spec: Provider integration with API key in config file]

5. Verdict: NEEDS WORK ⚠️
6. Feedback: "Spec must address batch mode processing (acceptance criterion 3)"
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### superpowers:writing-plans / superpowers:brainstorming
- **Input source**: Plans/specs produced by superpowers:writing-plans (simple features) or superpowers:brainstorming → superpowers:writing-plans (complex features)
- **Workflow**: brainstorming (complex) OR writing-plans directly (simple) → spec-reviewer validates → implement or revise
- **Feedback loop**: If NEEDS WORK, revise the plan/spec and resubmit for review

### Brianna Skill
- **Purpose**: Fetch Jira ticket for alignment verification
- **Usage**: Request description + summary fields only
- **Handle missing**: If ticket not found, cannot verify alignment (note in review)

### Tech-Lead Skill
- **Handoff**: After APPROVED verdict, tech-lead invokes superpowers:subagent-driven-development
- **Workflow**: spec-reviewer approves → tech-lead invokes superpowers:subagent-driven-development → implementation begins
- **Dependency**: tech-lead should not start implementation without an approved spec for complex features

## Error Handling

### Specification Not Provided
```markdown
Error: No specification provided for review.

Please provide:
- Specification content (paste directly)
- File path to specification document
- Reference to spec in conversation history
```

### Jira Ticket Not Found
```markdown
Warning: Unable to fetch Jira ticket EPMCDME-XXXXX.
