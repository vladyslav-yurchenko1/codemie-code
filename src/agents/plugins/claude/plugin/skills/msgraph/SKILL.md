  Work with Microsoft 365 services via the Graph API — emails, calendar events, SharePoint sites,
  Teams chats, OneDrive files, OneNote notebooks, contacts, and org chart. Use this skill whenever
  the user asks about their emails, inbox, unread messages, meetings, calendar, Teams messages or
  chats, SharePoint documents, OneDrive files, OneNote notes or notebooks, colleagues, manager,
  direct reports, or any personal/organizational Microsoft data. Invoke proactively any time the
  user mentions Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, OneNote, or wants to interact with their
  Microsoft 365 account. The skill uses a local Node.js CLI (msgraph.js) that handles
  authentication, token caching, and all API calls.

# Microsoft Graph API Skill

This skill lets you interact with Microsoft 365 services on behalf of the user using the
Microsoft Graph API. The Node.js CLI at `scripts/msgraph.js` handles everything — no Python
or extra packages needed, only the Node.js that CodeMie already requires.

## Setup & Authentication

**Check login status first** — always run this before any other command:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/msgraph/scripts/msgraph.js status
```

**Output interpretation:**
- `Logged in as: user@company.com` → proceed with any command below
- `NOT_LOGGED_IN` → follow the Login Flow below
- `TOKEN_EXPIRED` → session expired, also follow the Login Flow below

### Login Flow (first time or after expiry)

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/msgraph/scripts/msgraph.js login
```

This opens the **system browser** for Microsoft authentication (PKCE flow). If the browser
does not open automatically, a URL will be printed in the terminal — navigate to it manually.
After successful sign-in, the token is cached at `~/.ms_graph_token_cache.json` and all
subsequent commands run silently.

Use `--force` to re-authenticate even when already logged in:
```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/msgraph/scripts/msgraph.js login --force
```

### When NOT logged in or token expired

If status returns `NOT_LOGGED_IN` or `TOKEN_EXPIRED`, tell the user:

> "You need to log in to Microsoft first. Run this command in your terminal:
> ```
> node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/msgraph/scripts/msgraph.js login
> ```
> Your browser will open for Microsoft sign-in. If it doesn't open automatically, a URL
> will appear in the terminal — navigate to it to complete authentication."

## Workflow Patterns

### "Show me my emails"
1. Run `status` → check login
2. Run `emails --limit 15` → show results
3. If user wants to read one, run `emails --read ID`

### "What's on my calendar today/this week?"
1. Run `calendar --limit 10`
2. Parse dates in output and filter for user's timeframe

### "Find a file in SharePoint"
1. Run `sharepoint --sites` → list sites
2. Run `sharepoint --site SITE_ID` → browse files
3. Use `--path` to drill into folders
4. Offer `--download ITEM_ID` if user wants the file

### "Check my Teams messages"
1. Run `teams --chats` → list chats
2. User picks a chat → run `teams --messages CHAT_ID`

### "Show me my OneNote notes" / "Find a note about X"
1. Run `onenote --notebooks` → list notebooks
2. Run `onenote --sections NOTEBOOK_ID` → list sections
3. Run `onenote --pages SECTION_ID` → list pages, or use `onenote --search "keyword"` to search directly
4. Run `onenote --read PAGE_ID` → display page content

### "Show me the transcript from yesterday's standup"
1. Run `transcripts --start YYYY-MM-DD --subject "standup"` → finds the meeting and lists transcript IDs
2. Run `transcripts --meeting MEETING_ID --transcript TRANSCRIPT_ID` → reads full transcript text

### "Get all meeting transcripts for today"
1. Run `transcripts --start YYYY-MM-DD` → lists all online meetings for the day
2. Run `transcripts --meeting MEETING_ID` → lists available transcripts per meeting
3. Run `transcripts --meeting MEETING_ID --transcript TRANSCRIPT_ID --output meeting.txt` → saves each transcript

### "Who's my manager?" / "Who reports to me?"
- Run `org --manager` or `org --reports`

## Error Handling

| Exit code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | API error (shown in output) |
| 2 | NOT_LOGGED_IN — user must run `login` |

When you see `Permission denied` errors, it means the OAuth scope isn't granted for that operation.
This can happen if the user's organization has restricted certain Graph API permissions.

---

## Dependencies

**None** — the script uses only built-in Node.js modules (`https`, `fs`, `path`, `os`).
Node.js >= 18 is required, which is already a CodeMie prerequisite.
IMPORTANT: you must work with current date (get it from sh/bash)
