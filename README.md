## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally for best experience
npm install -g @codemieai/code

# 1. Setup (interactive wizard)
codemie setup

# 2. Check system health
codemie doctor

# 3. Install an external agent (e.g., Claude Code - latest supported version)
codemie install claude --supported

# 4. Use the installed agent
codemie-claude "Review my API code"

# 5. Use the built-in agent
codemie-code "Analyze this codebase"

# 6. Execute a single task and exit
codemie --task "Generate unit tests"

# 7. Connect to a remote MCP server (with automatic OAuth)
claude mcp add my-server -- codemie-mcp-proxy "https://mcp-server.example.com/sse"
```

**Prefer not to install globally?** Use npx with the full package name:

```bash
npx @codemieai/code setup
npx @codemieai/code doctor
npx @codemieai/code install claude --supported
# Note: Agent shortcuts require global installation
```

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

For the best experience with all features and agent shortcuts:

```bash
npm install -g @codemieai/code
codemie --help
```

### Local/Project Installation

For project-specific usage:

```bash
npm install @codemieai/code

# Use with npx
npx @codemieai/code --help
```

**Note:** Agent shortcuts (`codemie-claude`, `codemie-code`, `codemie-opencode`, etc.) require global installation.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie-code.git
cd codemie-code
npm install
npm run build && npm link
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
codemie --help
codemie doctor
```

## Usage

The CodeMie CLI provides two ways to interact with AI agents:

### Built-in Agent (CodeMie Native)

The built-in agent is ready to use immediately and is great for a wide range of coding tasks.

**Available Tools:**
- `read_file` - Read file contents
- `write_file` - Write content to files
- `list_directory` - List files with intelligent filtering (auto-filters node_modules, .git, etc.)
- `execute_command` - Execute shell commands with progress tracking
- `write_todos` / `update_todo_status` / `append_todo` / `clear_todos` / `show_todos` - Planning and progress tracking tools

```bash
# Start an interactive conversation
codemie-code

# Start with an initial message
codemie-code "Help me refactor this component"
```

### External Agents

You can also install and use external agents like Claude Code and Gemini.

**Available Agents:**
- **Claude Code** (`codemie-claude`) - Anthropic's official CLI with advanced code understanding
- **Claude Code ACP** (`codemie-claude-acp`) - Claude Code for IDE integration via ACP protocol (Zed, JetBrains, Emacs)
- **Gemini CLI** (`codemie-gemini`) - Google's Gemini for coding tasks
- **OpenCode** (`codemie-opencode`) - Open-source AI coding assistant with session analytics

```bash
# Install an agent (latest supported version)
codemie install claude --supported

# Use the agent
codemie-claude "Review my API code"

# Install Gemini
codemie install gemini
codemie-gemini "Implement a REST API"

# Install OpenCode
codemie install opencode

# Install Claude Code ACP (for IDE integration)
codemie install claude-acp
# Configure in your IDE (see docs/AGENTS.md for details)
```

#### ACP Agent usage in IDEs and Editors

**Zed** (`~/.config/zed/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "claude": {
      "command": "codemie-claude-acp",
      "args": ["--profile", "work"]
    }
  }
}
```

**IntelliJ IDEA** (`~/.jetbrains/acp.json`):
```json
{
  "default_mcp_settings": {},
  "agent_servers": {
    "Claude Code via CodeMie": {
      "command": "codemie-claude-acp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Emacs** (with acp.el):
```elisp
(setq acp-claude-command "codemie-claude-acp")
(setq acp-claude-args '("--profile" "work"))
```


**Version Management:**

CodeMie manages agent versions to ensure compatibility. For Claude Code:

```bash
# Install latest supported version (recommended)
codemie install claude --supported

# Install specific version
codemie install claude 2.1.22

# Install latest available version
codemie install claude
```

Auto-updates are automatically disabled to maintain version control. CodeMie notifies you when running a different version than supported.

For more detailed information on the available agents, see the [Agents Documentation](docs/AGENTS.md).

### CodeMie Assistants as Claude Skills or Subagents

CodeMie can connect assistants available in your CodeMie account directly into Claude Code. Register them as Claude subagents and call them with `@slug`, or register them as Claude skills and invoke them with `/slug`.

```bash
# Pick assistants from your CodeMie account and choose how to register them
codemie setup assistants
```

During setup, choose:
- **Claude Subagents** - register selected assistants as `@slug`
- **Claude Skills** - register selected assistants as `/slug`
- **Manual Configuration** - choose skill or subagent per assistant

After registration, use them from Claude Code:

```text
@api-reviewer Review this authentication flow
/release-checklist prepare a release checklist for this branch
```

You can also message a registered assistant directly through CodeMie:

```bash
codemie assistants chat "assistant-id" "Review this API design"
```

### CodeMie Skills

CodeMie skills are reusable assistant configurations you can register directly into Claude Code. Register them from your CodeMie account and invoke them as `/skill-name` inside Claude Code.

```bash
# Register CodeMie skills from your account
codemie setup skills
```

Registered skills use `codemie skill run` under the hood — when you invoke `/skill-name` in Claude Code, it calls the backend virtual assistant endpoint with the skill's full configuration (system prompt, toolkits, MCP servers).

You can also invoke a skill directly from the terminal:

```bash
codemie skill run "<skill-id>" "Your message here"

# Pipe message from stdin
echo "Explain this function" | codemie skill run "<skill-id>"

# Maintain conversation context
codemie skill run "<skill-id>" "Follow-up" --conversation-id <id>
```

Manage registered skills:

```bash
codemie skill list      # List all discovered skills
codemie skill validate  # Validate skill files
codemie skill sync      # Sync skills to Claude Code
codemie skill reload    # Clear skill cache
```

### Claude Code Built-in Commands

When using Claude Code (`codemie-claude`), you get access to powerful built-in commands for project documentation:

**Project Documentation:**
```bash
# Generate AI-optimized docs (CLAUDE.md + guides). Can be added optional details after command as well
/codemie:codemie-init

# Generate project-specific subagents. Can be added optional details after command as well
/codemie:codemie-subagents
```

**Memory Management:**
```bash
# Capture important learnings
/memory-add

# Audit and update documentation
/memory-refresh
```

These commands analyze your actual codebase to create tailored documentation and specialized agents. See [Claude Plugin Documentation](src/agents/plugins/claude/plugin/README.md) for details.

### OpenCode Session Metrics

When using OpenCode, CodeMie automatically extracts and tracks session metrics:

**Manual Metrics Processing:**
```bash
# Process a specific OpenCode session
codemie opencode-metrics --session <session-id>

# Discover and process all recent sessions
codemie opencode-metrics --discover

# Verbose output with details
codemie opencode-metrics --discover --verbose
```

Metrics are automatically extracted at session end and synced to the analytics system. Use `codemie analytics` to view comprehensive usage statistics across all agents.

## Commands

The CodeMie CLI has a rich set of commands for managing agents, configuration, and more.

```bash
codemie setup            # Interactive configuration wizard
codemie list             # List all available agents
codemie install <agent>  # Install an agent
codemie update <agent>   # Update installed agents
codemie self-update      # Update CodeMie CLI itself
codemie profile          # Manage provider profiles
codemie analytics        # View usage analytics (sessions, tokens, costs, tools)
codemie workflow <cmd>   # Manage CI/CD workflows
codemie doctor           # Health check and diagnostics
codemie mcp-proxy <url>  # Stdio-to-HTTP MCP proxy with OAuth
```

For a full command reference, see the [Commands Documentation](docs/COMMANDS.md).
